The steps I use in my image are:

Install all available updates

yum update -y
Install the EPEL helper package

yum install -y epel-release
Install cloud-init and dracut-modules-growroot

yum install -y cloud-init dracut-modules-growroot
This has to be done after installing epel-release, because otherwise YUM won't look in the EPEL repository, where dracut-modules-growroot is available.
Cloud Init is useful in running startup scripts, but it also has an enabled-by-default module (great documentation, right?) that resizes the root filesystem (resize2fs-like) if its block device is bigger.
You can avoid installing it, but then you'll have to resize the filesystem on your own (see my second ugly script).

Rebuild all initramfs images.

rpm -qa kernel | sed 's/^kernel-//'  | xargs -I {} dracut -f /boot/initramfs-{}.img {}
This is very important. Without rebuilding the initramfs images, the module won't be available and nothing will get done.
Also note that I'm explicitly rebuilding an image for every kernel package installed - this is because we might be running kernel A, and just installed newer kernel B with yum update -y, so if I only used dracut -f only kernel A's image will be rebuilt, and next time we'll boot from kernel B's image, that doesn't have the module.

The full script:

yum update -y
yum install -y epel-release
yum install -y cloud-init dracut-modules-growroot
rpm -qa kernel | sed 's/^kernel-//'  | xargs -I {} dracut -f /boot/initramfs-{}.img {}
